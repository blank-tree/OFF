## Installation

To use this site, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [php](https://php.net/) (7.1 or greater)
- [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)


### Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:blank-tree/offfffffffffff.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd offfffffffffff
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.

You'll need a mysql-db and a php-engine to run this project. Setup the `secret.php` with the missing credentials.
